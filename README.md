# Git Training

What is version control, and why do we care?

Version Control Systems (VCS) are a category of software tools that help a software team manage changes to source code over time. 
Version control software keeps track of every modification to the code in a special kind of database. 
If a mistake is made, developers can turn back the clock and compare earlier versions of the code to help fix the mistake while minimizing disruption to all team members.

Primary functions of a VCS:

* Track changes over time
* Enable multiple developers to evolve codebase together and collaborate
* Enable developers to make changes without fear of “losing” something that already works

What is git, and why choose it?

Git is a VCS. If you’re interested in learning about how git came to be, here’s the TL;DR version of the story.

We chose git at Surya because:

* It is popular
* It works reasonably well
* It has great tools built around it

The one downside of git is that it is rather confusing to learn. 
The commands often do not make any sense, and git makes it rather easy to shoot yourself in the foot. 
However, once you get used to it, git is an extremely powerful tool.

## Exericses

This project contains certain exercises along with relevant documentation teaching the basics of Git. 
The goal is to complete the following exercises by the end of the day, in the given order.

1. [Creating A Pull Request](exercises/creating-a-pull-request/README.md)
2. [Resolving Merge Conflicts](exercises/resolving-merge-conflict/README.md)
3. [Git Ignore](exercises/git-ignore/README.md)
4. [Revert Commits](exercises/reverting-commits/README.md)
